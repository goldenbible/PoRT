What is cruel here? Tell me please. I will tell you what is cruel. Cruel was don't help me to get to English speaking country, cruel was to decline when I proposed to take away Bible Site with charity links, cruel was to decline my job applications. Cruel is to don't stop psycho screams of ru people in my head. I know you ca help me and they can stop it, I already checked it. I hear them even when I see name of their country.  Cruel is to ignore my tweet with invitation to work on these charity projects or take away Bible Site. Cruel that I have less than hundred bucks and I'm sleeping on bus station at night. Cruel is to blame me when I'm thinking or programming by any of your "sharpy" words. You got it? So, now we wait when I will finish work on main site of PoRT, then I will add there your banners. Thanks.


Well, thank you to them who support at least, with goods and thoughts. In telepathy I'm receiving good messages too. Thank you very much - it helps me keep going and doing charity project =]

Don't worry too much, I'm still being gentle as I can and loving people. Just sometime I need very good protection...
